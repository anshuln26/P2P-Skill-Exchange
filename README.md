# Peer-to-Peer Skill Exchange
> *"Your Knowledge Becomes Currency"* — A Free Time-Bank & Credit-Economy Knowledge Platform

---

## 🎯 The Core Philosophy: Knowledge Currency

The platform operates on a **Time-Bank Knowledge Economy**:
* **1 hour of teaching = 1 credit earned (+1 Cr)**
* **1 credit spent = 1 hour of learning (-1 Cr)**
* **Zero real money transactions** — Knowledge is the only currency.
* **The Barter Problem Solved:** If User A wants to learn Guitar from User B, but User B doesn't want User A's Excel skill:
  - User A teaches Excel to User C $\rightarrow$ User A earns +1 credit.
  - User A spends that credit to learn Guitar from User B.

## 🔑 Core Features & Highlights

1. **Deterministic Rule-Based Matching Engine**:
   - Strictly 100% explainable matching without black-box AI.
   - Computes score across 5 factors: Skill overlap (+50), Availability overlap (+20), Session mode (+10), Community rating (+10), Experience (+10).
   - Shows users exact match reasons (e.g., *"✓ Teaches Guitar which is on your wishlist"*, *"✓ Shared weekend availability"*).

2. **Immutable Credit Ledger**:
   - Double-entry bookkeeping: every credit movement creates a permanent `CreditTransaction` record.
   - Types: `BONUS`, `HOLD`, `RELEASE`, `EARN`, `SPEND`, `REFUND`.
   - Dynamic balance calculation: $\text{Spendable} = \text{Total} - \text{Reserved} \ge 0$.

3. **Double-Confirmation Trust Protocol**:
   - When a session concludes, the teacher clicks *"Mark Session Complete"* and the learner clicks *"Confirm Completion"*.
   - Only when **both** have confirmed are credits settled from escrow.

4. **1-on-1 Real-time Peer Chat**:
   - Active WebSocket coordination between booked session participants.

5. **Admin Control Console**:
   - Real-time platform statistics (circulating credits, active sessions, popular skills).
   - User moderation (suspend/reactivate).
   - Dispute arbitration with ledger-backed refund or payout actions.
